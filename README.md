Overview
---

This is a first project for Self Driving Car Nanodegree on Udacity.

To run it simply install necessary dependencies (listed in the bottom) and run P1.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

There are also three files included:
- functions.py
- videos.py
- image.py
These files are copies of algorithms from P1.ipynb, fitted to work without Jupyter Notebook.

Feel free to do anything with this project, play, expermient and if you have some advice how to improve it - please let me know.
