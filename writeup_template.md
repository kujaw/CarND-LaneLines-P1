**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I blurred image using Gaussian blur filter to reduce image noise. Those two steps were necessary to further perform edge detection on the image using Canny edge detection algorithm. Afterwards I drafted area of interest for line finding algorithm so that no lines will be detected outside this area making whole process more accurate. Then the image is processed by Hough Line Transform to output detected straight lines. In the end both raw image and image with only lines draw are combined so user can see an image from camera with draw lines on it.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
